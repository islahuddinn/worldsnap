                <p>
                  These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted
                  by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute
                  the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                  failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                  Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                  provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                  permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                  obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                  or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
                  caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
                  provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
                  determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                  provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from
                  these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and
                  enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                  venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
                  created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or
                  use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not
                  be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
                  hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the
                  electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing
                  by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
